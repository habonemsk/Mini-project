With this App, users can effortlessly manage their tasks and events, helping them stay organized and on top of their to-do list. We hope you enjoy and we look forward to your contributions!

## What is new and different

1. test the ability of AI to multitasking:By keeping track of the problem number he should give the solution and respect the guidelines of the ouput. Then he should write the output into a file and each time update the same file for the 10 problems.
2. What is new: Each time he AI has to retrive 10 problems listed and execute. form problem 1 to 10 he memories the 9 problems and forgot what was the 10th problem retrive from the file. Each time I am reloading the input file and guid him from which problem to start. 
                From the next set of problem starting from 11th problems to 20th, from 17th problem, he is lose of track of the problem to solve and he came up with a problem of he is own.
                From the next set of problem starting from 21th problems to 30th, from 27th,28th,29th,30th problems,he again lost track and he came up with a problem of he is own.  
 		    This continue as we move to the next 70 problems.	
3. Suggestions: we have to look into deept why this repeative lost of track and when he lost track of the problem to solve where the problem het training to excecute come from.
