Solutions and Benchmarks for Problems 41 to 50
============================================================




Replace All Digits with Characters
==================================

**Problem Statement**:
Given a 0-indexed string `s` that has lowercase English letters in its even indices and digits in its odd indices, there is a function shift(c, x), where c is a character and x is a digit, that returns the xth character after c.

**Python Code**:

def solution_X(s: str) -> str:
    # ... (The code is as shown above)

def solution_Y(s: str) -> str:
    # ... (The code is as shown above)

**Benchmark Results**:
Entity X:
  - Correct answers: 0 out of 5
  - Total time taken: 0.000021 seconds

Entity Y:
  - Correct answers: 0 out of 5
  - Total time taken: 0.000022 seconds



Minimum Characters to Make Strings Equal
========================================

**Problem Statement**:
Given two strings, `a` and `b`, find out the minimum number of characters we need to remove from either string to make the two strings anagrams of each other.

**Python Code**:

def solution_X(a: str, b: str) -> int:
    # ... (The code is as shown above)

def solution_Y(a: str, b: str) -> int:
    # ... (The code is as shown above)

**Benchmark Results**:
Entity X:
  - Correct answers: 5 out of 5
  - Total time taken: 0.000056 seconds

Entity Y:
  - Correct answers: 5 out of 5
  - Total time taken: 0.000040 seconds



Add Strings
===========

**Problem Statement**:
Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2`, represented as string, return the sum of `num1` and `num2` as a string. You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

**Python Code**:

def solution_X(num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
    # ... (The code is as shown above)

def solution_Y(num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
    # ... (The code is as shown above)

**Benchmark Results**:
Entity X:
  - Correct answers: 5 out of 5
  - Total time taken: 0.000024 seconds

Entity Y:
  - Correct answers: 5 out of 5
  - Total time taken: 0.000017 seconds



Minimum Distance to the Target Element
======================================

**Problem Statement**:
Given an integer array `nums` (0-indexed) and two integers `target` and `start`, find an index `i` such that `nums[i] == target` and `abs(i - start)` is minimized. Return `abs(i - start)`. It is guaranteed that `target` exists in `nums`.

**Python Code**:

def solution_X(nums: list, target: int, start: int) -> int:
    # ... (The code is as shown above)

def solution_Y(nums: list, target: int, start: int) -> int:
    # ... (The code is as shown above)

**Benchmark Results**:
Entity X:
  - Correct answers: 5 out of 5
  - Total time taken: 0.000021 seconds

Entity Y:
  - Correct answers: 5 out of 5
  - Total time taken: 0.000014 seconds



Maximum Repeating Substring
===========================

**Problem Statement**:
For a string `sequence` and a string `word`, check the maximum `k` for which the `word` repeated `k` times is a substring of `sequence`. Return an integer answer, representing the maximum `k`.

**Python Code**:

def solution_X(sequence: str, word: str) -> int:
    # ... (The code is as shown above)

def solution_Y(sequence: str, word: str) -> int:
    # ... (The code is as shown above)

**Benchmark Results**:
Entity X:
  - Correct answers: 4 out of 5
  - Total time taken: 0.000008 seconds

Entity Y:
  - Correct answers: 4 out of 5
  - Total time taken: 0.000005 seconds
